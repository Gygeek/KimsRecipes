    "Heat the oven to 350°F. Lightly coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Cut 3 ounces of the Gruyere cheese into thin pieces. Grate the remaining 1 ounce Gruyere cheese using the large holes of a box grater.",
    "Whisk eggs, half-and-half, Dijon mustard, salt and black pepper in a large bowl until combined.",
    "Cut croissants crosswise into three pieces each (24 pieces total). Working one at a time, dip the croissant pieces in the custard and arrange in the baking dish, nestling the pieces tightly together. Pour the remaining custard evenly over the top.",
    "Halve the ham slices. Fold each piece in half, roll into a rosette, and nestle in between the croissant pieces around the baking dish. Place the sliced cheese between the croissant pieces around the baking dish. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top.",
    "Bake until the center is set and slightly puffed and the croissants are golden-brown, 40 to 45 minutes.",
    "A few minutes before the casserole is ready, stir melted unsalted butter, grated garlic, chopped herbs and 1 pinch kosher salt together in a small bowl. Brush over the top of the casserole after it comes out of the oven, and serve.",
    "Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to four days."
