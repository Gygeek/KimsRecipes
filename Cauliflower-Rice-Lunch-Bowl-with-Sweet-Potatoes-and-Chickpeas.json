  "steps": [
    "Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to \\(425^{\\circ}\\) F. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, then season with \\(1 / 2\\) teaspoon of the salt and several grinds of black pepper. Toss to combine, then arrange into an even layer. Roast on the lower rack until beginning to brown, about 20 minutes.",
    "Flip the sweet potatoes and push them to one side. Add the pumpkin seeds to the now-empty portion of the baking sheet and crumble the feta into large pieces over the sweet potatoes. Place the cauliflower rice (if using frozen, break up any clumps first), turmeric, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, \\(1 / 2\\) teaspoon of the salt, and several grinds of black pepper on a second rimmed baking sheet and toss until evenly combined. Spread into an even layer.",
    "Place the sweet potatoes on the upper rack and the cauliflower rice on the lower rack. Roast until the pumpkin seeds are toasted, the sweet potatoes are golden-brown, and the feta is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl and toss until evenly coated; set aside.",
    "For each serving: Transfer \\(1 / 4\\) of the rice, \\(1 / 4\\) of the sweet potato and feta mixture, and \\(1 / 4\\) of the chickpea mixture into a bowl. Sprinkle with \\(1 / 4\\) of the pepitas and top with a piece of the avocado (peel the avocado if eating immediately). Drizzle with more olive oil and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve with a lime wedge."
