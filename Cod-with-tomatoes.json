    "Lightly season the cod with ½ teaspoon of the salt and set aside.",
    "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the tomatoes break down and a thick sauce forms, 4–5 minutes.",
    "Increase heat to medium‑high; add the wine and bring to a vigorous simmer. Stir constantly to burn off some alcohol, about 1 minute.",
    "Reduce heat to medium; stir in the olives and capers. Nestle the cod fillets into the center of the skillet and spoon the tomato mixture over them. Cover and cook until the fish is opaque and heated through, 6–8 minutes.",
