      "40 cloves garlic",
      "4 sprigs fresh thyme",

      "1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf Italian parsley"

  },
  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 375°F.",
    "Heat a large pan to medium heat with the olive oil. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels then season well with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the chicken thighs skin side down then add the butter to the middle of the pan. Sear for 6-8 minutes or until well browned. Turn the thighs over and cook for another 5 minutes. Place the seared thighs onto a plate and tent with foil.",
    "Turn the heat to medium-low and add the garlic cloves to the pan. Cook until they turn golden (about 5 minutes).",
    "Add the vermouth and chicken stock and turn the heat to high. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge the brown bits. Once the liquid reduces by half, mix in the thyme, and turn off the heat.",
    "Place the chicken thighs into the pan, skin side up. Spoon some of the sauce and the garlic cloves on top of each piece of chicken.",
    "Roast for 1 hour or until the chicken reaches an internal temp of at least 185°F. Let the chicken rest for at least 5 minutes before serving. Top with the parsley and the tarragon before serving. The roasted garlic can be eaten as is or spread onto crusty bread. Make sure to mop up the sauce with crusty bread. Enjoy!"
