  "Steps": [
    "Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "In a 9Ã—13\" baking dish add the cherry tomatoes, olives, pressed garlic, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, sea salt and pepper to taste. Toss everything well to coat.",
    "Place the feta block in the center of your baking dish. Drizzle feta with the remaining olive oil.",
    "Bake for 15 minutes, or until feta begins to brown and tomatoes are bursting.",
    "Meanwhile, steam your cauliflower florets for just 5-6 minutes or until tender-crisp. Do not overcook the cauliflower, we don't want them mushy.",
    "Once your feta is done baking, carefully remove from the oven and immediately start to mash and combine the feta and tomatoes with a fork, to create a creamy sauce.",
    "Stir in your steamed cauliflower florets together with the second batch of minced garlic and a tiny pinch of sea salt and pepper. Top with your freshly grated mozzarella and return to the oven.",
    "Bake for 15-20 minutes, until bubbly and golden on top.",
    "Garnish with fresh parsley and enjoy!"
