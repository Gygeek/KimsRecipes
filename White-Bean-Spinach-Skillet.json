    "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ½ cup shallots and ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes; cook, stirring often, until the shallots are softened, about 3 minutes. Add minced garlic and ½ teaspoon salt; stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ½ cup wine and increase heat to medium-high; cook, stirring often, until the wine is almost fully reduced, about 2 minutes. Add 2 (5-ounce) packages baby spinach; cook, stirring, until starting to wilt,... about 2 minutes. Add rinsed beans and ½ cup broth; cook, stirring gently, until heated through and the spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in ½ cup cream and ½ cup Parmesan. Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons Parmesan. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon basil. Serve with crusty bread, if desired."
