  "steps": [
    "Add the butter and oil to the Instant Pot. Hit “Sauté” on the “More” or “High” setting and wait until the butter has melted.",
    "Add the shallots and cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then add in the white wine and let simmer for 1 minute more.",
    "Add the broth, lemon juice, clam juice (NOT the clams), basil, oregano, parsley, Old Bay, and pepper and stir together well.",

    "Secure the lid and hit “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” High Pressure for 6 minutes. Quick release when done.",
    "Stir in the clams and the Parmesan. Let sit for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, so the clams get heated through and the sauce thickens.",
