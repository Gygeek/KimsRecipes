  "steps": [
    "Prepare the Homemade Creole Seasoning: Mix all ingredients (4 parts chili powder; 2 parts each: salt, onion powder; 1 part each: black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, dried thyme) thoroughly. Store in an airtight container.",
    "Step 1: Prepare the Blended Creamy Base",
    "Turn your Instant Pot to Sauté mode on high. Add 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil for the base.",
    "Once hot, add the chopped sweet onion and 1 cup of celery for the base. Sauté for 4-5 minutes until softened.",
    "Add 2 minced garlic cloves for the base and sauté for another minute until fragrant.",
    "Stir in the rinsed white rice, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, chicken broth, and 1/2 cup clam juice into the base mixture.",
    "Secure the lid, set the valve to Sealing. Select Pressure Cook (or Manual) mode and set the timer for 10 minutes at high pressure.",
    "Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow a 10-minute Natural Pressure Release, then carefully perform a Quick Release for any remaining pressure.",
    "Open the lid. Using an immersion blender (or carefully transferring in batches to a regular blender), blend the base mixture until completely smooth.",
    "Stir the heavy cream, fresh/dried basil, and 1/4 tsp black pepper into the blended base. Taste and add salt if needed. Set this blended base aside. Rinse the Instant Pot liner if necessary.",
    "Step 2: Create the Pan Roast Stew",
    "Set the Instant Pot to Sauté mode on high. Add 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil for the stew.",
    "Add the chopped yellow onion, 1 cup of celery for the stew, and green bell pepper. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened. Add 2 minced garlic cloves for the stew and cook for 1 more minute.",
    "Pour in the white wine (or vermouth) to deglaze, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let it bubble for a minute.",
    "Stir in the brandy, 1 cup of clam juice, Old Bay seasoning, your desired amount of Homemade Creole Seasoning, paprika, optional cayenne, Worcestershire sauce, optional hot sauce, optional honey, and the bay leaf into the stew.",
    "Bring this stew mixture to a simmer.",
    "Step 3: Combine and Cook Seafood",
    "Pour the reserved Blended Creamy Base into the simmering stew mixture in the Instant Pot. Stir well to combine.",
    "If using Andouille sausage, add it now and let it simmer for 5 minutes.",
    "Add the seafood to the simmering pan roast. Cook gently on Sauté mode (adjust to low or medium if bubbling too vigorously) just until shrimp is pink and opaque and scallops are cooked through (usually 3-5 minutes). Avoid overcooking. If using delicate crab meat, stir it in during the last minute.",
    "Step 4: Serve",
    "Discard the bay leaf. Taste the pan roast and adjust seasonings if necessary (salt, pepper, Creole seasoning, hot sauce).",
    "Serve hot in bowls, traditionally with a scoop of Jasmine rice in the center.",
    "Garnish with fresh chopped parsley."
